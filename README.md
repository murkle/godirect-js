# GODIRECT JS - Vernier Go DirectÂ® Sensor Library

This is a quick hack of the [original library](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-js) mostly to help me understand how it works. I've removed the WebBluetooth support and deleted/simplified a lot of code so it's easier to understand but you probably shouldn't use this for anything serious. It's been tested only with the Go Direct Temperature sensor
